-------
During the 2000s, the number of soldiers physically stationed in the Middle-East skyrocketed. However, in 2019, this number is continuing to decease. It’s wonderful that the western world has less of a military presence in other countries, presumably to a negligible amount on the next 5 to 10 years.

-------
An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.

English,5,"Questions 3-5 are about the following passage:

-------
Some are insisting on retaining the old ways. One morning show host, with a fickleness typical to the category, announced the other day that people should fill cinema halls and support the flailing local industry — I suppose even if it means becoming numbers in a pandemic of an airborne virus. Those numbers, the gift of Omicron, are not simply rising; they are skyrocketing. According to the US Centres for Disease Control, America alone is supposed to reach a million cases of Covid-19 a day by mid-January — this in a country where 61 per cent of the population has been double vaccinated and many have received a booster dose of the most effective Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.

Closer to home, the situation in China is also expected to be dire. A study that was done in Hong Kong recently revealed that even three doses of the popular SinoVac vaccine do not provide immunity against the Omicron strain. The Sinopharm vaccine has also been found to have lower efficacy against Omicron. It is not surprising that a few days ago the Chinese reported the greatest daily surge in several months in cases of the Omicron variant. This has particular relevance for Pakistan, where weddings, social gatherings, offices and educational institutions have all gone back to functioning as normal.

Given all these facts and realities, none of which are likely to change in the near future, 2022 requires ’re-conceptualisations’ rather than resolutions. Constant school closures owing to environmental hazards and now disease mean that our structures of providing instructions are no longer able to function in the way that we meant them to. Rethinking this may necessitate changes in the way children go to school and what they are able to do there.
